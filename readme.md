## About Thesis management

Thesis management is a web based app built with laravel 5.5
to keep track of thesis work for a department in higher institution
of learning. It records info about the paper, author and supervisor and also
groups them according to year, level and scope of the paper. Searching for project
is also possible using different search tags.
